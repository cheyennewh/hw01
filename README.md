Hello, my name is **Cheyenne Wakeland-Hart** and I am a rising fourth-year in the college. Most of you don't know me very well, so I'd like to take the opportunity to introduce myself!

## What Do I Study?
I am a Neuroscience/Psych *double* major within the college and have spent the last two years focusing on memory research. I am interested in the interaction between memory and attentional states and am currently working on projects in:
* The [Uchicago Memory Lab](https://voices.uchicago.edu/memorylab/)
* The [CAB Lab](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/research/)

### What Else Do I Care About?
* **Cat Mom**
  * I am a cat Mom *est. August last year* to the furball Wonder. He's a very cute, very *loud* orange tabby who loves naps with mom and yelling during Zoom calls.

* **Campus Activist**
  * For the past three years, I have been very active with campus organizations such as the Student Library Workers Union, Resources for Sexual Vioence Prevention, and Society for Students of Color, which are committed to empowering different groups on campus.  
* **Guitar Player**
  * To counterbalance the UChicago workload, I took up guitar as a hobby about 2 years ago. Most of what I play falls into the genre of prog-rock or math-rock and focuses on instrumental guitar.
